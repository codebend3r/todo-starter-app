# Todo App

Created with create react app (CRA)

## Todos

---

- [x] give the main title an underline and a different font family
- [x] show a message if there are _no todos_, in other words if the array `toDoList` is empty
- [x] within each todo created, while in edit mode, give that input field (<input />) a class name and style it
- [x] within each todo created, move the group of buttons all the way to the right (align right)
- [x] move everything with `<div className="o-task-addition">` into it's own new component, call it `TaskAdder`
- [x] on every todo item created, get the current date/time it was created and store it but don't show it
- [x] save all data to local storage, so when you refresh the page it doesn't go away
- [x] the clear all button should still clear all data even after you refresh the page >
