# Todo App

Created with create react app

## Todos

- give the main title an underline and a different font family
- within each todo created, while in edit mode, give that input field (<input />) a class name and style it
- within each todo created, move the group of buttons all the way to the right (align right)
- on every todo item created, get the current date/time it was created and store it but don't show it
- save all data to local storage, so when you refresh the page it doesn't go away
- the clear all button should still clear all data even after you refresh the page
